# RCT2-Left-Indent-Maze-Corridor-Simulator
Simulates a guest in a left-indent maze corridor, according to the rules given here https://youtu.be/KVgoy_a_gWI?t=116

The corridor is infinitely long, and the guest starts in the centre, facing upwards. Given the number of steps n, the program calculates the probability of the guest making
a certain amount of progress in n steps, with going one tile upwards being +1 progress, and downwards -1 progress.
